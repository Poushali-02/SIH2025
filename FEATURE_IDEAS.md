## Suggested Initial Implementation Sequence (Phase 1–3)

1. Phase 1: Claim lifecycle basics, RBAC, polygon upload/drawing, audit log, advanced claim search.
2. Phase 2: Spatial overlap detection, LULC change timeline, risk scoring (MVP), reporting dashboard.
3. Phase 3: Queue-based processing, proximity analytics, appeals flow, conversational assistant.

## Data Model (High-Level Sketch)

Tables/entities to plan: users, roles, claims, claim_status_history, claim_geometries, documents, document_hashes, tasks, audit_log, ml_model_registry, notifications, spatial_indexes.

---

## Tech Stack Additions (Proposed)

- Backend: Node/Express → Add PostgreSQL + PostGIS, Redis, BullMQ.
- Frontend: MapLibre/Leaflet upgrades, react-query for data caching, state machine (xstate) for claim lifecycle.
- AI: Lightweight Python microservice for ML scoring (FastAPI) coexisting with OCR service.
